# Python Facial Recognition with Hand Recognition

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/saolghra/Python-Facial-Recognition?style=for-the-badge)

This is a Python program that utilizes facial recognition and hand recognition to perform various tasks. It uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces and hands in images or video streams.

## Features

- Facial Recognition: The program can detect and recognize faces in images or video streams. It uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features.

- Hand Recognition: The program can also detect and recognize hands in images or video streams. It can track hand movements and gestures, allowing for interactive applications.

- Customizable: The program provides options to customize the recognition models, thresholds, and other parameters to suit your specific needs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Facial-Recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program.

2. Provide the input source (image or video stream) for facial and hand recognition.

3. The program will detect and recognize faces and hands in the input source.

4. Perform the desired actions based on the recognized faces and hands.
